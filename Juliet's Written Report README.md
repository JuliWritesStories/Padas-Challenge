# Padas-Challenge
Juliet Messier's Module 4 Pandas Challenge
# Summary of Analysis
In today's challenge we analyzed city school data by combining csv files on school and student data
From this data, we analyzed school budgets, math and reading scores, pass rates, and aggregate students.
We filtered this data by performance, grade, spending, school size, and school type

# Conclusions
Two conclusions I pulled from this data regard Charter schools and per student spending
There seems to be a positive correlation between charter school enrollment and math scores.
Charter school students are performing 27% better at math than their public school counterparts. 
This may warrant further investigation into how charter school environments help with math performance.
Per student spending does not seem to impact student performance.
For instance, the worst performing school spends $55 more per student than the top performing school.
This may indicate that performance may have something more to do with parts of the school environment outside of the money spent on each student.
